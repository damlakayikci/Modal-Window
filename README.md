# Modal-Window

🧑🏻‍💻 Here is a very small project to understand how JavaScript works with click event.

  In this project, there are three modal buttons which are connected to the same text, and when clicked display the same message on the screen. To close the modal just click the '×' icon or anywhere out of the modal. Or you can simply press the key 'esc'.
  In this project, I used JavaScript to add and remove CSS classes from HTML
  You can also find detailed notes about certain methods in the 'script.js' file.
